* Google Fonts uses Github Releases to manage font families. If you feel your font project has hit a milestone, you must create a new release for it. In order to do this, go to the releases page and hit the "Draft a new release button". You must provide a tag number and title which can only be a decimal number e.g 0.100, 1.000 etc. For the body text, mention what has changed since the last release. Once you are done, hit the "Publish release" button. Here is an example which fulfills the requirements, https://github.com/m4rc1e/test-ufr-family/releases/tag/2.019. For more info regarding Github release, please see the official Github Release [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository). **Please note that Github Actions must be able to build the fonts before you can make a release. Once you have made a release, the fonts and tests assets will be attached to the release automatically. This may take a while since the fonts and tests will be built from scratch so please be patient.**

* Remove this section from the readme. :-)

Description of your font goes here. We recommend to start with a very short presentation line (the kind you would use on twitter to present your project for example), and then add as much details as necesary :-) Origin of the project, idea of usage, concept of creationâ€¦ but also number of masters, axes, character sets, etc.

Don't hesitate to create images!

## About

Description of you and/or organisation goes here.

## Building

Fonts are built automatically by GitHub Actions - take a look in the "Actions" tab for the latest build.

If you want to build fonts manually on your own computer:

* `make build` will produce font files.
* `make test` will run [FontBakery](https://github.com/googlefonts/fontbakery)'s quality assurance tests.
* `make proof` will generate HTML proof files.

The proof files and QA tests are also available automatically via GitHub Actions - look at https://googlefonts.github.io/morisawa-biz-ud-mincho.
